##
joint space <-> end effector space
joint space is [angle, angle, angle, angle, angle]
end effector space is cartesian (x, y, z)

## kinematics
acceleration:
-----       
     ------
           -----

bang ground bang

maximum acceleration followed by saturation (and 0 accel)
and negative acceleration


## body joint link 
body:
    not able to move
joint:
    nD movement
link:
